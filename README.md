Jupyter Notebook + Visualizations for my blog post [Movie Review Aggregator Ratings Have No Relationship with Box Office Success](http://minimaxir.com/2016/01/movie-revenue-ratings/). Additionally, you can [view a screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Hjlkxw_2A) explaining the notebook in greater detail.

Note that Star Wars: The Force Awakens Box Office Data is not in the dataset since the RT data was retrieved about November 2015.
